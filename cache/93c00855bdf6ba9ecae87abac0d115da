Oliver, you have made me a better human. I will aim for comfort, but no longer covet luxury and holiday houses made of mink and tusk”.\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd the disparity between rich and poor shriveled and the theme tune to Different Strokes played throughout the land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it didn’t quite turn out that way. There never seems to have been a time where to place a price on everything was considered more right and proper. If you’re not looking to fuck over someone in a deal, you must be asleep on your watch or some half-witted throwback, the end of your family line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, I am not made of stern enough stuff to crush. I am a namby pamster who is a little embarrassed about money. I’d rather not bring it up. If someone asks me how much I will cost for something, I wince. “How much have you got…you know…what sort of budget…for someone who does something like I do…I don’t want to be greedy…I mean, I’d rather not lose money doing the event…”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIDIOT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arts is filled with such fools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is an embarrassment in bringing up cash, the fact we are allowed to create at all without being imprisoned or tortured should be our reward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany will have found themselves at events where everyone working in the room is being paid for their time and expertise, apart from the artist. They are being paid by those generous enough to look at them and enjoy them and have moments of their lives made happier by them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile others work and sweat and become oily or tired, the artist is just scattering their mind about. The arts are a vocation and you must consider yourself lucky to have been born or shaped into a position where you can daub, scribble or spout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther professions suffer this too. Look at the lucky nurses who have chosen to care, not like the poor hedge fund managers who suffer such agonising indigestion from long fizzy lunches that they must be paid top dollar, these lucky things are born to wipe and help and save, they deserve less than the lunched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I know quite a few comedians who find payment a troubling, but necessary, matter, the entertainments industry (the industry? that professional dicking about should have usurped smelting plants and coal mining to have become an industry) is often less coy. A very funny and award winning young comedian told me how an agent had once told him that his act was not “financially viable”. A friend of mine went to visit a prospective agent, when asked what sort of career he’d like, he said he quite liked the sort I had. The agent spluttered as if in a Punch cartoon. My career, though it has brought me truly fulfilling moments and a chance to work with my heroes and create some ridiculous and pointless events that have, at the very least, delighted me, is not a proper career. I am neither fabulously wealthy nor famous. He later went on to show off that, when doing a deal that involved one of his clients, he had screwed me out of money repeatedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are in the age of the content provider. Your canvases are not art, they are wall covers. Your songs are silence concealers. Your jokes are emptiness mufflers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am fortunate to have a comfortable life working on projects I enjoy. I am still learning and hope to maintain that until a few seconds after my heart gives out. I still grit my teeth and clench my fists when I turn down silly money to do things I know I shouldn’t. I was recently offered a corporate for some stockbrokers. The money would have covered the cost of the corner of artspace which I share with some illustrators and where I keep my messy desks for two years. I am fortunate to be in a position where I can do this, though each time I do that, I see my future self shoeless, hungry and alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still find it hard to put a worth on what I do. I am happy to tell people, “this is the most I have got paid for doing this sort of thing, and this is the least”, and then hoping they will be fair. I am sure some may gleefully underpay, but I can always say no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie Long and I have decided to start podcasting again. This is why I was pondering money. Until quite recently, we didn’t like the idea of charging for such things, but we have come to the conclusion that, hopefully, enough people have enjoyed what we do, and will, that we can ask for some money from those that can afford it, to spend our time and use our creativity to make something that is good, or at least good for those that like this sort of thing. I am hoping we are not too conceited to imagine this. Are we worth any of the spare cash that may be spent on craft beers, pub gigs, apps or pinball machines?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre we grotesque now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill we find out that our lives and minds are worth nothing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould we ever be financially viable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you would like to support our new endeavor, you can donate as little as you wish, but if your hedge fund is heaving, why not use us as a tax write off?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.patreon.com/user?u\u003d2306511\u0026amp;ty\u003dh\"\u003ePledge here if you can.

Some of them were relentlessly superior, their stuck up noses as sharp as a pencil caricature. They were the most fun. In their fog of boorishness, they were oblivious to his sarcasm and facetiousness. He could fob off the direst tracts to them buy fabricating a story of how some Nobel prize winning physicist or Booker winner had been reared on this book. He had sold books on the pretext of them famously being part of Einstein’s childhood library. The fact they had not been first published until 1947 or 1963 or whatever didn’t seem to hinder the customer’s gullibility. They were the people that could be sold anything because they believed they knew everything, a situation they had comfortably reached by knowing nothing. They had probably been victims of their own parents desire to destroy their child’s interest in reading by insisting they read Nausea at seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not as bad as many of them. She usually came on a Wednesday. Many customers did as the boss was out then. The boss would push any old tat. It was “all about the bottom line”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he had got to know her, he knew she liked to browse for a while before being disturbed.\u003cbr\u003e\nHe would let her start the conversation. On the first few visits he had been too sharp in his approach. She would drift through the picture books, into the classics, and onto teenage fiction. The visits became longer. It was now nearly an hour before she approached him and asked what sort of people liked a book of a silly verse or an intricate pop up book of planets, asteroids and rocket ships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t a young mother, probably approaching middle age. She’d left having children until she’d satisfied herself with a career he imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked tired today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are these books about dinosaur astronauts popular?”\u003cbr\u003e\nThey were alright, but if he was honest with her, and he would be, he thought they were books written by committee. The pictures were charmless and flat, the stories were perfunctory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you wouldn’t recommend them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think we have better books.

She was distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shall I just put together some of my favourites and you could look at them in the reading corner”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was staring blindly at a dinosaur in a stetson with a laser gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shop door opened and the electronic chime broke the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, I missed what you said”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wondered if I should just put together a pile of books in the reading corner and you can go through them in your own time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, yes”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat on the solid plastic pink chair in the shape of a once popular TV pig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chose carefully. Remembering the ones that he had offered her in the past.\u003cbr\u003e\nShe only mentioned one child, but presumed there might have been more, or maybe a stepchild. When she first came in, she bought little novels and Lewis Carroll and Wind in the Willows, but she never bothered with anything like that anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe topped up the pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do remember that he is a little bit more advanced than the others? he’s more like a six year old than a three year old. You should hear the things he says”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was peculiar to him how many parents never brought their children in to choose the books they might like, maybe that would destroy the illusion they could have when they came in insisting their child was Max Planck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leafed through the stack, but she was barely looking at them. In the past, she scrutinised the text and pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could I look at something for younger children? I am thinking of books for party bags, I don’t want to tax the other children”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up some pop ups and a series of stories about a clumsy lion and a his Machiavellian mouse friend.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt was getting close to 530.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll be closing soon, but I don’t mind staying open for a little longer if you need a little more time”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snapped from her distracted stated into a look of sharp horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Christ, what time is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gathered up some of the pop ups and one clumsy lion book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll pay with card. If these are a bit too babyish, can I bring them back”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were a little more childish than her last visit, but he hoped that she was beginning to realise that it was better to learn to love reading than to brutishly shape your child’s reading into a thing of achievement over joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That will be fine. Just keep the receipt, but I’ll remember you anyway. That’s £27.94”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bagged them as the card machine took its time over dealing with the transaction.\u003cbr\u003e\nShe looked sharp and impatient again. Over the months, she could soften, but then that other mother appeared, that mother that knows every day at the nursery gates there will be another competition. Who will be the first to play Bach?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was sitting on his bed when she got home. He looked tired and a little grumpy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look what I’ve got you. New books. Lions!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the pop up in front of him, but he was in a mood with her. She opened the pop up with a flourish and the snake leapt at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe burst into tears. It was too late for all this.\u003cbr\u003e\nSilly of her really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tears tumbled down into his beard. She should shave him again. She’d taken an eye off these things.

Look at you. Fucking Hell”. I was surprised, that didn’t sound like my normal opening, even when doing the Pointless Anger shows with Michael Legge (he is in charge of swearing output, I handle the overly niche references). I was quite taken aback to read it (it was tweeted to me, I don’t go searching my name on the internet). It felt odd to have so little memory of being so brutish. Initially, I was in denial, desperately seeking some neuronal activity that would jog the memory into the front of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Work for me for you fucking calcium ions, ah fuck, there I go again. maybe I have a condition”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, it has fallen into place. To the bemusement of the audience, I started the show with Michael Legge in the guise of an aggressive Daphne and Celeste act, singing ferocious, disemboweled version of “Ooh Stick You…” and “U.G.L.Y.”, then straight into compering with Josie Long, with my caterwauling Daphne guise still simmering. Overall, I think I am surprisingly unsweary by the standards of the current circuit, but now a corner of the web will know me as Robin “Fuck. Look at You. Fucking hell” Ince. I thought the Shy tory opening was tongue in cheek, clearly I delivered it with too much authenticity, such a pity the Royal Shakespeare Company never call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I have “officially” stopped stand up, I have had a benefit and a few outings in various guises at Latitude and something feels a little awry. I don’t feel creative or engaged on stage. I should have drawn the line a little thicker and made the Stop sign bolder. Only have a few little gigs left, a trip to Edinburgh, some benefits, the John Peel Center (how could I say no) and a festival in Folkestone, but nothing more for this year and next. My impostor syndrome is energetic, because for now, I am one. The manic show off departed after the gig at The Bloomsbury, and he should sleep now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the rest of Latitude, it was excellent. It has been some time since I have had the opportunity to wander the site so freely with the time to see so much. Despite the cliches that may be trotted out on some stages by me and others, it is a pretty remarkable feat. There is so much bloody art and so much bloody good art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was lucky enough to host an event with three of Yonderland – it is a superbly stupid creation – “this is not a good day to be made of jelly” (a slight misquote of dialogue from a blue jelly)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chris Goode Company’s \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.chrisgoodeandcompany.co.uk/current-shows/\"\u003eStand\u003c/a\u003e was a passionate piece of documentary theatre performed with superb authenticity by actors including Michael Fenton Stevens, Cathy Tyson and Spencer Brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDolores Haze are a noise, punk to post punk jolt from a band who look like a drawing of Riot Grrrls by Edward Gorey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Districts were good independent-ish americana guitar music of a type that will see them on the main stage soon I would imagine (a good album too, but not a favourite of 2015).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimber Timbre sounded at times like Link Wray performing PiL’s Order of Death and sometimes like the mighty Morphine interpreting My Charona, magnificent.

Live comedy is a non-invasive form of trepanning.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is a chance to release the angry spirits within you with a lower risk of septicemia, unless your angry spirits stir the audience to throw broken bottles at your head.\u003cbr\u003e\nI wrote a post a while a go about why I was stopping stand up, I have not returned to it as most of it is probably gobbledegook and the sort of blether that surfaces when you are touring alone ten thousand miles from home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night was the “official” final show, though as I underlined, it is a final show for now. Over the next six months, my diary has as many gigs in it as I usually have down for a week. I have not gone off stand up, quite the opposite. It is because I value it a great deal that I don’t want to let myself down by becoming tired, nonchalant or blasé about it. I mentioned Rik Mayall at the end of my gig, after all, it was witnessing his magical brutality and wide-eyed stupidity that led to me attempting to show off for a living. Every time you saw him, it looked like total bloody commitment, no half measures, no dead eyed, counting the money in his head demeanor on his face. The older I have become, the more I appreciate the necessity of total commitment. My penultimate gig was shoddy. My brain was dozy and I do not function well on autopilot. I left the stage feeling I had cheated both myself and the audience. These occasions have grown fewer over the years, but it never stops smarting when they happen. “what a bloody disgrace”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think my insomnia became an overbearing thug in my existence precisely because the fear of letting the audience down and therefore myself became more and more important. The cackling homunculus hiding behind a lobe would whisper until dawn, “there’s not half measures in your game, but how are you going to justify yourself on 90 minutes sleep. Oh how the people of Wolverhampton will rage at you”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final show at The Bloomsbury was very different to Bath. There was just the right level of anxiety to sharpen the mind. Perhaps it would have been best to have had a shoddy show, then I could look back on it and think, “well, it’s pretty obvious why you are ceasing stand up, look at that mess you spewed out and slid in on your final night”.\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I enjoyed showing off. I talked very fast. I barely even ran over, the whole night was done in two hours and forty minutes. And Grace Petrie was superb as usual, firing out justified political ire before driving the tears out of everyone’s eyes with a beautiful song about Charles and Emma Darwin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had more to say, but there came a point when I thought, “that is enough”, let them leave before the Stockholm syndrome kicks in and we all drink the Kool-aid. (poor Kool-aid, once the by-word for a refreshing drink, now a trademark shortcut to mean cult insanity).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I’m going to go hunting for ideas and landscapes to try and fill in a few of the vast, echoing caverns of my ignorance. Back in the Winter months, I wondered if I might find that this sabbatical would lead to a dawning realisation that I should have been doing something else all along, and thus my Bernard Black existence would fill the rest of my life, decaying and decalcifying in my seafront bookstore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI may be wrong, but I think a stand up is what I am, and it is going to be a challenge to not have the chance to immediately release new ideas on a crowd or smattering. Hopefully, these ideas will gestate over the years or die before being mouthed, and whatever I come back with will be better than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you to everyone who has supported all my tours and solo shows.\u003cbr\u003e\nI still have a few things in my diary.

Though anyone who knows us will be aware that most of the benefits we agree to are based on our desire to create a dystopian future that maximises people’s misery, this is not such a venture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agreed to the benefit, as I have all the other free fringe benefits, to support the acts and the idea of it. The money goes towards creating the PBH’s Free Fringe brochure so hopefully helps all the shows get an audience. The money does not go to Peter Buckley Hill’s beer and Ferrari fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI, and other acts, have been criticised for not pulling out of the show due to the current stalemate and confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy have I not pulled out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause as yet, I have not seen enough evidence of heinous skullduggery. This is a fucked up situation, but it still does not seem clear to me who is to blame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe version of events I have seen so far, and this seems to be changing depending on whose facebook statuses you monitor, is that a venue was booked full of acts before the landlord was confirmed. When the landlord was confirmed, he did not want that particular booker and, again from the version of events I have been told, was angered when he heard it had all been booked without his permission. A further problem was that there were far more rooms needed than the landlord wished to create for the fringe. The story of how this hopeless scenario occurred is still a mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have not seen a full account of why the initial booker believed it was definitely theirs to book. I have read some status updates, though they seem far from transparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have also seen status updates that seem fueled by animosity towards Peter Buckley Hill that has built up long before this incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most important part of this is to house those acts currently with fringe listings and without venues and work out the most effective way to publicise where they will be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would also seem to be useful to hear from the current landlord and those who were the potential landlords as this could make thing far clearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know we are always meant to act like a government reacting to tabloid rumours of dangerous squirrels, act first and fuck the evidence, follow the flags of popular outcry, but I try to make decisions based on the clearest possible version of events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo many egos, not enough facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am sure there is more to be revealed in the next hours and days and I will keep up to date with what information comes out and my actions and reasoning may change, but I’d rather not lynch now and regret later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAddendum: Much is being made of the fact that the Free Fringe only informed the Fringe the day before the brochure deadline (8th april) . Some acts believe this was done maliciously to punish them for joining Freestival. Surely it would then have been better to say nothing. If the Fringe had taken this seriously, they could have contacted the acts. The brochure is not printed the day after the deadline, in fact, there is still  a week to change from the proof copy (at least from my experience), so all this nonsense could have been stopped in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a statement put up on Facebook from Frank Gailbraith, with intro by Paul B Edwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps it would be a good idea to read this statement just released by Frank Galbraith (our man in Edinburgh and one of the only people who knows all about the Cowgatehead fiasco:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi Guys,\u003cbr\u003e\nJust to keep you all updated we have now completed discussions with the Cowgatehead licensee and the Fringe Office regarding the mis-reported claims that Freestival had rights to use the venue during Edinburgh Fringe 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\nThese continued claims by Freestival that PBH, the licensee and the owners are all to blame is only a shameful smokescreen to cover up their mishandlings and I can only assume avert possible civil action claims.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo that everyone is clear on these issues, having previously had discussions with the building owners and a potential licensee, we emailed the Fringe office on 7th April 2015 of a possible conflict of interest in using Cowgatehead this year and to be wary accepting advertisements from performers until the venue licensee and promoters were confirmed. We were then contacted by the newly confirmed licensee on Tuesday 19th May, and had Edinburgh meetings with him on Wed 20th and Thur 21st May, agreed and exchanged contract details on us promoting events at Cowgatehead \u0026amp; Cowshed, Bar-Bados (St Johns) and Tron Kirk.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe also had further Edinburgh meetings with the licensee on Tuesday 2nd and Wed 3rd June 2015, and also met with the Edinburgh Fringe Society management on the Wednesday afternoon when the licensee, Peter and I further confirmed the position with the fringe office.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt has been very disappointing to read some of the social media reports and comments, from several performers and a few bloggers/journalists, that Peter Buckley Hill and the Free Fringe organization team had irresponsibly taken use of the venue, left 150 performers without a stage to perform on and £1000’s out of pocket. It was also disturbing to read Freestivals claims that we refused to compromise on relinquishing or sharing the venue and that we further refused to attend pre-arranged mediation with the licensee, fringe office and Freestivals sponsors in London on Tuesday 2nd May 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhilst it’s understandable that the concerns of the performers have foundation, it is disappointing that some of them have taken to shamefully denouncing PBH in their social media posts based on grossly inaccurate information given to them by their promoter.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is also extremely concerning to us and the licensee that Freestival are continuing their claims that a verbal agreement existed and that the FREESTIVAL LTD board have backed a petition demanding they be given the venue and are considering legal action against the licensee.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe recent claims by Freestival that they had hammered out a compromise agreement with the licensee and that we had declined the compromise deal was incorrect. Their further claims that a London compromise meeting, with the licensee and the fringe office being in attendance, was cancelled due to our non attendance was also fabricated.\u003cbr\u003e\nNot only was the reported meeting never agreed or programmed by the licensee, the fringe office management had no confirmed details of it either, other that what was told to them by Freestival.\u003cbr\u003e\nOn the alleged London meeting date the licensee was at pre planned meetings in Edinburgh with members of the PBHFF team.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo that we are all clear on this point the licensee has confirmed with us and the fringe office that NO COMPROMISE MEETING WAS EVER AGREED OR EVEN DISCUSSED WITH FREESTIVAL FOR THEM TO USE OR SHARE THE BUILDING. What was apparently discussed during Freestivals Edinburgh meeting on 25 May, was that the licensee would meet with Peter to discuss the affected acts, as apparently Freestival informed the licensee that Peter had refused to take any of the displaced acts.\u003cbr\u003e\nAs Peter has already reported, the genre AD’s are presently working extremely hard finalising offers with the affected Freestival acts and 51 of the 89 CGH acts that are listed in the EdFringe programme have already had their allocated slots with us confirmed.\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, despite our efforts to sort out this mess, it is still shocking to read recent posts by Freestival that an Eleventh hour compromise may still be possible if PBH can be convinced to give up the venue. This is simply not an option we could consider, as the licensee has already informed the Freestival organization that they were never promised use of the venue nor would they be offered usage in any of their venues due to the yet unreported conduct of Freestival during the venue bidding process.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn recent statements Freestival reported that discussions had been on going since 2014 with the prospective licensees and the building owners, whom they claimed are the same management company as their sponsors La Favorita. These statements were grossly inaccurate and served no purpose other than to mislead people.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe facts are that La Favorita and their owners have never had ownership of the building and as such no agreements or authority could have been given to Freestival. The actual owners of the building and both perspective licensees (The decision makers) confirmed to us that no agreement with Freestival was ever in place. They (The decision makers) have also pointed out that this can be backed up with Corroborating Evidence.\u003cbr\u003e\nI am also personally angered to see the barrage of abuse towards PBH, the Free Fringe committee \u0026amp; organising team, the licensee and the building owners. Some of the posts include suggesting people should veto our venues AND that our London fundraiser performers should reconsider their association with PBHFF. This in my opinion has exceeded the acceptable lines of voicing their protestations.\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease be assured that we have all conducted ourselves in a professional manner throughout this and we do not deserve the criticism that has been thrown at us. We do however take on board that the emotional outbursts from the performing community is only on the back of information given to them by their promoter.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are also extremely saddened to hear about several acts that expect substantial financial losses this year due to the unfulfilled promises and agreements they had with Freestival. We of course cannot guarantee putting all the affected acts back into the rooms promised to them by Freestival due to the fact that three of the rooms simply do not exist. Had Freestival been in discussions with the licensees, as they have claimed, they would have known that one of the floors they claimed to have as a staged area in will in fact be a music bar. Simply put there is only enough room for six stages. However, we are presently in discussions regards putting in place contingency plans to secure additional venues/stages to accommodate the remaining displaced acts that wish to apply to us and our own acts that have been waiting patiently.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is our hope that the Freestival team will now move on and concentrate on their own show preparations and cease this senseless course of vindictive action towards the Free Fringe organisation.\u003cbr\u003e\nI trust this explains some of the many questions asked of me recently and that we can now concentrate on our own final preparations in ensuring Edinburgh Fringe 2015 is our best to date.\u003cbr\u003e\nRegards,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope everyone can now move on, as he suggests.

The problem is that it is ultimately the acts who end up being victims. The main points seem to be –\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. more rooms were offered than will exist at the venue for the fringe, eleven rooms when there will only be six, as much of the space is being used for music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Peter did not approach the landlord, he approached Peter to book the venue. This seems to be where one of the issues may be, the lease had not actually been assigned to the venue at fringe programme deadline. As far as I can see, it is a very poor idea to book a venue based in the hope your chosen landlord gets control of it. Perhaps Freestival were talking to someone they believed was in charge of the venue when they were not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Peter put a hold on booking any alternative acts for a week until those who believed they had a place under Freestival made it known they still wished to be at Cowgatehead. As there are not as many rooms as were offered, it seems there is no way of accommodating all. This is where the parlous state comes in. PBH’s Free Fringe is being blamed for leaving acts out in the cold when it is down to the fact there are just not going to be the rooms promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought it was important to get these important to put these points up again as it seems this situation is being turned into a heroes and villains situation unfairly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe saddest thing is that this debacle is making all the free fringes and festivals look like the whole thing is a turf war and leaving acts with dashed hopes and debt. There may have been many people who have been misled in this situation, and I am not entirely sure why the Fringe office didn’t act when they were warned that the Cowgatehead venue lease was still on the table. Shouldn’t they have spoken to those booking it and warned them that it wasn’t safe practice to book out rooms in a venue when you don’t know who will have ultimate control of it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe free fringes and festivals have helped revitalise much of the fringe and encourage more experimentation and given opportunities to new acts without the money to play major venues, it is great pity that it has descended into this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  \u003ca rel\u003d\"nofollow\" href\u003d\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/robinince.wordpress.com/2354/\"\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\"\" border\u003d\"0\" src\u003d\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/robinince.wordpress.com/2354/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cimg alt\u003d\"\" border\u003d\"0\" src\u003d\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host\u003drobinince.wordpress.com\u0026amp;blog\u003d15951285\u0026amp;post\u003d2354\u0026amp;subd\u003drobinince\u0026amp;ref\u003d\u0026amp;feed\u003d1\" width\u003d\"1\" height\u003d\"1\"\u003e","categories":["Uncategorized"]},{"mediaGroups":[{"contents":[{"url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0699132fd32e05a8345688e66eecae3b?s\u003d96\u0026d\u003didenticon\u0026r\u003dG","medium":"image","title":"robinince"}]}],"title":"Losing My Religion – on why I am giving up stand up","link":"https://robinince.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/losing-my-religion-on-why-i-am-giving-up-stand-up/","author":"robinince","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 22:05:08 -0700","contentSnippet":"Before reading this post, I should reiterate that I love stand up and reading back over this, it probably looks a bit ...","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBefore reading this post, I should reiterate that I love stand up and reading back over this, it probably looks a bit melodramatic. In the act of writing about it all, everything seems much clearer now. So you could well dismiss this whole thing if you wish.

This is the biscuit box selection of regular and occasional doubts. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been a stand up comedian for over half my life, and now it is time to stop talking.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt was January 2014 when I started to think, this showing off has got to stop.\u003cbr\u003e\nI have no idea what the effect of closing my professional bile and jumping about valve will be, perhaps I will be murdered by my wife not long afterwards.\u003cbr\u003e\nOr maybe I’ll fall silent and like it.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is not that I have gone off the idea of stand up, or that I have come up with some grand or minor project to usurp it. It is an experiment. What happens to me without it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reasons why I have decided to stop change regularly.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I am in a good mood, or post a successful gig, I wonder why I am going to attempt this silence, but in the shadows near the back of my skull, I know I should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost friends reckon it will last about a month. I want to give it at least two years, and then review the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy notebooks have scribbled sentences that explain to me why I am doing this. Some of them I agree with as I am typing them out, others I am not sure of in my current frame of mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. The main reason is my son. He is seven and I am not around enough. I am in a position that I can take a sizable chunk of time off and play Doctor Who Top Trumps and go to dinosaur museums, so I should do just that. I try to ration tour dates. My agent is responsive when I say I only want to do three shows in a week, but then others ask for talks or appearances at peculiar and fascinating events and that’s 7 days of the week gone. Cutting down is not an option. Total abstinence is required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. My impostor syndrome is more vibrant now than it was in 1992. I still don’t think I am a proper comedian. I find myself on benefit bills and look around a green room of professional comedians, people who really know how to do it, and wonder how I have snuck in with my mind shambles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Paranoia is rife. However well a gig is going, I have drawn faces of fury on the front row. If everyone seems to be laughing, I am imagining the lone man in the audience is furious with it all. Later, he explains to other members of the audience that it was actually awful, and they realise they have been conned. Towards the end of the gig, I look down at the person whose face I have scribbled on to make it furious, and it turns out they are jolly. I must stop graffiting the audience’s faces with felt tipped fury emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. I am stuck in my niche. I like the world I am in. I like the audience I get, but there still seem to be too many towns where I can’t get more than a few stalls seats sold. I can go from 600 people to 43 in 24 hours. The ego deflates like a spitty whoopee cushion..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. All this science has brought on doubt. Why am I saying what I am saying? Do I know what I am talking about? Is there anything original being exhaled? This is much the same reason I stopped writing a regular blog – my “shut up shut up shut up” inner voice began to screech. Once I am off stand up, I will also depart social media for a while too, for more effective shutting up. So if I disappear for a while, I can do some reading and looking through microscopes \u0026amp; telescopes and working out what I might think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6. Aren’t there enough middle class white males talking already?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7. Sometimes I look at stand up and see all the commercialisation, the demographic researching, the secret writers making up observations for the big name, the disco ball illuminations, and I remember the less funny, but more passionate stand up 15 year old me saw in some gum and burn hole carpeted pub room, and I go off it. I know there are many wonderful, curious, exciting acts really, but for a moment, that knowledge slips away as I see the same panel on every panel show. The seating position and the desk colour may change, but look, there’s Jimmy Carr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8. I see the work of Daniel Kitson or Bridget Christie or John Kearns and face my limitations. Do I delude myself that I may be capable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9. I think I was starting to go mad. I didn’t have some Hancockian black dog hovering above me, more a facetious little grey dog yapping. In Hull and Alnwick, I started to lose hold of the leash I keep my English emotions on (as poor Grace Petrie knows).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10. Insomnia decided to deposit itself in my gut and brains sometime ago. As I want each show to be better than the last, this hoped for perfectionism was stymied by that self-loathing homunculus who sneered at 3am – “how can you do the show justice when you won’t have slept for 49 hours. Hee hee hee”.

Let’s see if I can give up stand up for longer than I gave up whisky, or if the addiction is such that I’ll start busking jokes outside the Hayward Gallery by August. This whole thing may just be a nonsense, and in a matter of weeks I will be pugnacious, facetious and armed to play low turnout border towns all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have two more gigs in Australia, then a couple of months of UK gigs, from St Austell to Salford, Leeds to Bristol,  ending up at \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.thebloomsbury.com/event/run/14372#book\"\u003eThe Bloomsbury, London\u003c/a\u003e.

Was I more sure of the world at 15 or 45? I was never that sure of anything, apart from the diseases I thought I had and that those people over there in the cafe were laughing at me because of my shoes, hair, walk or face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone else seems so sure. Are they all discreetly hiding their imposter syndrome, or do they really know what they know?\u003cbr\u003e\nMaybe this scepticism was a bad idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the cocksureness (I prefer cockcertainty, but that doesn’t seem to be a word as yet) that I keep knocking my head into that is swelling my uncertainty about nearly everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many arguments where facts are stated and never backed up by evidence.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo many universal truths that can only be traced back to rumour or misheard pub talk.\u003cbr\u003e\n(Culture Wars: The Media and The British Left is a very good compilation of how those 80s staples like “they have banned black bin liners for being racist” sprung from).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been accused of being arrogant and smug for asking people where their opinions came from. Last week, someone accused me of criticising and dismissing the work of an individual who I had never heard of (nor did I know of their work). When I asked the accuser why they believed that I believed what they thought I believed, they flew off the handle, they started swearing and taking great umbrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was told some alarming foreign aid statistics that seemed improbable, I was told that I was an idiot for not knowing about them, and if I couldn’t find these statistics, I should look harder. I searched and came up with nothing. I was then told that everyone knew they were true and the fact they didn’t exist anywhere and could be backed up by nothing did not change their veracity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, I read of there is a launch of an Anti-Feminist party, as we all know, men are the real victims now and “Feminism is a hatred, and it should be a badge of shame”. Misogyny is apparently very rare and… oh, I have to stop typing now, I must force myself to believe this is all a grand parody that will have a delightful absurdist reveal. I have to presume this man really believes what he believes. His reality is granite solid, he is certain of his truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was asked to write a reaction piece on the Hebdo murders and free speech, but I could find nothing but banal and obvious observations, so I declined. I could think of nothing that I might say that could contribute, not even in a pay per sentence scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am only typing this to try and diagnose my illness, to try and locate the the thought blockage and decide whether it should be flushed out or if a sharp burst of a bicycle pump up the nose will shift it, or whether it should stay write where it is – a needed wall that should have been built some time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel I should have opinions all the time.\u003cbr\u003e\n“I haven’t tweeted anything for ages, quickly, think of a view of the world that can fit into 140 characters. Now monitor the reaction – was it an opinion that stirred or has it shriveled up and died on contact with the web?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn, that person’s opinion on the thing I was opinionated on has been favourited more than mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat purpose this slurry pipe of my perpetual opinions? Is it just to air my brain before it festers and rots in fluid of aging, septic thought. Is the internet predominantly a trepanning tool?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow deluded am I? When people have created such impervious bundles of barbed wire around what they must and will believe, what is the point of butting in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think it is time to read Neil Postman on Media ecology, which he described as looking into “the matter of how media of communication affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; and how our interaction with media facilitates or impedes our chances of survival” – but will trying to understand really help, or should I just read less and drink more?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are not in London, information on my forthcoming gigs in Didcot, Bedford, Swindon, Glasgow, Salford, Swindon and on, is \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.robinince.com\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd info of USA gigs\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.infinitemonkeycage.com/tickets/\"\u003e HERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Australian tour \u003ca href\u003d\"http://atheistfoundation.org.au/2014/12/04/robin-ince-happiness-through-science/\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  \u003ca rel\u003d\"nofollow\" href\u003d\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/robinince.wordpress.com/2340/\"\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\"\" border\u003d\"0\" src\u003d\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/robinince.wordpress.com/2340/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cimg alt\u003d\"\" border\u003d\"0\" src\u003d\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host\u003drobinince.wordpress.com\u0026amp;blog\u003d15951285\u0026amp;post\u003d2340\u0026amp;subd\u003drobinince\u0026amp;ref\u003d\u0026amp;feed\u003d1\" width\u003d\"1\" height\u003d\"1\"\u003e","categories":["Uncategorized"]}]}}, "responseDetails": null, "responseStatus": 200}
