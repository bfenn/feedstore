He explains that there is huge opportunity for technology to help address old problems that have, ironically, been accelerated by new technology: transparency, privacy, unequal ownership (of information) and inequality of access. One such opportunity, he says, is in developing the block chain, the encryption technology that is the basis of Bitcoin, the open-source currency. “The block chain is a means of storing information that cannot be hacked or altered,” says Chesha, “and because the information is decentralised and dispersed over a network, rather than accessed through one server, it is more robust.”\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFriday, 10 July, 2015 - 12:00\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSource: \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://medium.com/the-design-economy/the-democracy-interface-time-to-upgrade-f8998b0024ea\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/the-design-ec...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eTags: \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/tags/press-hit\"\u003ePress Hit\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/tags/cris-chesha\"\u003eCris Chesha\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/tags/blockchain\"\u003eblockchain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","categories":[]},{"title":"The True Cost of the Budget","link":"http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/cris-chesha/true-cost-budget","author":"Cris Chesha","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 Jul 2015 07:03:12 -0700","contentSnippet":" \"A National Living Wage, starting at £7.20 and rising to £9 an hour by 2020, replaces the £6.50 minimum wage.\" -- BBC News ...","content":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\"A National Living Wage, starting at £7.20 and rising to £9 an hour by 2020, replaces the £6.50 minimum wage.\" \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e-- \u003ca rel\u003d\"nofollow\" href\u003d\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33437115\"\u003eBBC News \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, any increase in the minimum wage is somewhat welcome news, no matter how small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as manipulation goes, you\u0026#39;ve got to hand it to George: this is a 10/10.
