At least a decade before homing devices in the form of ankle monitors or bracelets were first used, a Scarfolk inventor called Matthew Shipton set out to find a solution, drawing upon his years of experience working for toy manufacturer, Scar Toys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking with Dr. Hushson of Cavalier Pharmaceuticals, who had made his name hybridising children with kitchen appliances for the catering industries (see \u003ci\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Discovering-Scarfolk-Richard-Littler/dp/0091958482\"\u003eDiscovering Scarfolk\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/i\u003ep. 121 for more details), Shipton surgically implanted his daughter\u0026#39;s musical box into a lesser-favoured nephew.

Children up and down Scarfolk wanted to be fitted with their favourite toys. The demand was so great that Scar Toys and Cavalier Pharm went into production. Their Surgical Toy Insertions were the #1 Christmas gift five years in succession. \u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, the prison system adapted Shipton's musical boxes so that, instead of containing twirling ballerinas, they housed bulldog clips which nipped at the vital organs of criminals if they transgressed. \u003ci\u003eClare de Lune\u003c/i\u003e, however, was retained for its calming effects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee more from Scar Toys here: \u003ci\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://scarfolk.blogspot.com/2015/05/lung-puppy-sentient-toy-1975.html\"\u003eLung Puppy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee more from Cavalier Pharm here: \u003ci\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://scarfolk.blogspot.com/2015/07/mindborstal-psychological-detention-drug.html\"\u003eMindborstal\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e","categories":["1970s","advertising","BBC","board games","children","christmas","discovering scarfolk","ethics","experiments","games","medicine","merchandising","minors","prison","products","surgery","toys","TV"]},{"title":"Public Information Booklet: \"What To Do When...\" (1976)","link":"http://scarfolk.blogspot.com/2015/10/public-information-booklet-what-to-do.html","author":"Scarfolk Council","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 02:12:00 -0700","contentSnippet":"Below is one page from \"What To Do When...\", published in 1976.

Overspending was unavoidable and the threat of closure was ever present. However, Scarfolk Council's department for health and knitting hit upon a simple method to radically reduce spending.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, taking its lead from a household insurance policy, the council recategorised many serious (thus expensive) illnesses as ineligible for treatment. Cases were dismissed due to \"general wear and tear\" or \"acts of god\", and the council even went as far as to recommend that patients with serious physical ailments \"contact the manufacturer for further assistance\". Secondly, the spread of disease in hospitals was cut by 90% by removing and prohibiting sick patients.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatients with cheaper, non-threatening conditions were admitted to NHS hospitals, but only if they understood that they might share a bed with up to 9 other patients and/or a startup business that had rented the bed as office space. Patients were also subjected to virtually costless placebo trials. In fact, all treatments in 1979 were placebos consisting of either sherbert infusions (the town mayor was a major stakeholder in a Scarfolk confectionery factory) or daily rituals conducted by a coven of witches, who chanted in hospital car parks around an effigy of a nature deity made from balloons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cost-cutting scheme was successful and other regions adopted the same model. Not treating people was the only way to keep the NHS a viable, going concern, permitting it to continue what it has always done best: treat people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e","categories":["1970s","Britain","capitalism","Council","government","healthcare","hospitals","NHS","occult","pharmaceutical","PIF","poster","PSA","Public Information","Scarfolk","sickness","social services","totalitarian","witchcraft"]},{"title":"\"Thought Policy\" Leaflet (1976)","link":"http://scarfolk.blogspot.com/2015/08/thought-policy-leaflet-1976.html","author":"Scarfolk Council","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2015 02:39:00 -0700","contentSnippet":"Below is a leaflet published by the Scarfolk council department that was set up in 1973 to deal with citizen thought detection ...","content":"Below is a leaflet published by the Scarfolk council department that was set up in 1973 to deal with citizen thought detection and control.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the thought-detector vans which prowled Scarfolk's streets (see \u003ca href\u003d\"http://scarfolk.blogspot.com/2013/03/thought-detector-vans-1973.html\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e for more information), citizens were expected to undergo regular thought inspections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the time, thought terrorism was rife and most major public buildings and spaces had security checkpoints.
