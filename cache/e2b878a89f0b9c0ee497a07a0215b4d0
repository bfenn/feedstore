From insects that can be used to give a precise time of death, to the unusual field of forensic botany, It's not just DNA evidence that can be used to pinpoint someone to the scene of a crime. They are joined on stage by Professor Sue Black from the University of Dundee, Dr Mark Spencer, a forensic botanist at the Natural History Museum and comedian Rufus Hound.","categories":[]},{"mediaGroups":[{"contents":[{"url":"http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p02y4szn.mp3","fileSize":"33063333","type":"audio/mpeg","medium":"audio","expression":"full","duration":2834.0,"lang":"en-GB"}]}],"title":"Speed","link":"http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p02y4szn.mp3","author":"","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 Aug 2015 17:00:00 -0700","contentSnippet":"The Need for Speed\n\nThe Monkey Cage returns from its tour of the USA, as Brian Cox and Robin Ince take to the stage of the BBC ...","content":"The Need for Speed\n\nThe Monkey Cage returns from its tour of the USA, as Brian Cox and Robin Ince take to the stage of the BBC Radio Theatre to look at the science of speed.

How would the evolution of life on our planet have differed without plants, and what would our planet look like today? Most crucially that seemingly dull but necessary process of photosynthesis that we all learned about in school, is in fact one of the most important processes in our universe, and as usual it seems, the physicists are trying to take credit for it.
