We devise a method for querying FinFisher's \"anonymizing proxies\" to unmask the true location of the spyware's master servers.  Since the master servers are installed on the premises of FinFisher customers, tracing the servers allows us to identify which governments are likely using FinFisher.  In some cases, we can trace the servers to specific entities inside a government by correlating our scan results with publicly available sources.  Our results indicate 32 countries where at least one government entity is likely using the spyware suite, and we are further able to identify 10 entities by name.  Despite the 2014 FinFisher breach, and subsequent disclosure of sensitive customer data, our scanning has detected more servers in more countries than ever before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://citizenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image00.jpg\"\u003eHere's\u003c/a\u003e the map of suspected FinFisher users, including some pretty reprehensible governments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTwo \u003ca href\u003d\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/researchers-find-impossible-to-trace-spyware-in-32-countries\"\u003enews\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a46ad09bfcc142909deaadfac7504b8a/despite-exposure-new-nations-joining-cyberespionage-game\"\u003earticles\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e","categories":["citizenlab","cyberespionage","espionage","privacy","spyware","surveillance"]},{"title":"Breaking Diffie-Hellman with Massive Precomputation (Again)","link":"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/10/breaking_diffie.html","author":"Bruce Schneier","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 04:19:11 -0700","contentSnippet":"The Internet is abuzz with this blog post and paper, speculating that the NSA is breaking the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange ...","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Internet is abuzz with this \u003ca href\u003d\"https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/haldermanheninger/how-is-nsa-breaking-so-much-crypto/\"\u003eblog post\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy-ccs15.pdf\"\u003epaper\u003c/a\u003e, speculating that the NSA is breaking the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol in the wild through massive precomputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote about this \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/05/the_logjam_and_.html\"\u003eat length\u003c/a\u003e in May when this paper was first made public.

The handshakes are forwarded to a decryption oracle, a black box system that performs the magic. While this happens, the wiretaps also record all traffic in the associated IPsec connections.\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a period of time, this oracle either returns the private keys or says \"i give up\".
