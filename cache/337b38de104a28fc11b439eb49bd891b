Richard discusses some zombie based movie ideas he has had, before introducing the dry-witted and incredulous Diane Morgan who isn't quite sure what she's let herself in for. And it's a surreal, dream-like and occasionally mildly awkward chat about working with Ken Campbell; Richard's failure to see one of Diane's first performances; Bruce Willis on The One Show; Richard's ever-spiralling shoplifting problem; the slight let down of earliest memories (and what is the latest earliest memory that anyone has ever had?); and the importance of making it clear that you're not dating Joe Wilkinson. Find out who Diane would kill if she had one bullet and no repercussions, and what she thinks might be in a medieval pie.","categories":[]},{"mediaGroups":[{"contents":[{"url":"http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/228489633-britishcomedyguide-richard-herring-lst-podcast-82-stuart-goldsmith.mp3","fileSize":"89837145","type":"audio/mpeg"}]}],"title":"Episode 82 - Stuart Goldsmith","link":"http://www.comedy.co.uk/podcasts/richard_herring_lst_podcast/episode_82_stuart_goldsmith/","author":"Comedy.co.uk","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 03:02:00 -0700","contentSnippet":"RHLSTP #82: Stuart Goldsmith - Rear Window.

RHLSTP is back (it feels like it never went away) and another kickstarted series begins ALL FOR FREE. Richard is worried that David Cameron has just made all his emergency questions irrelevant and amazed by the way the world has changed in the brief hiatus between series. And it's a PODCLASH as his first guest is the host of the brilliant Comedian's Comedian Podcast as well as Richard's backdoor neighbour, Stuart Goldsmith. With (pretty much) all new emergency questions to try out there's a lot to talk about including how to breathe fire, what Rumpel the Kangaroo King is really like, the BBC's plans to transport all children to the future. Also there's speculation on egg-gate and shit-by-the-gate-gate, as well as the opportunity to purchase a property with a direct view of Stuart Goldsmith's penis.

It's the last show in Series 7 and there's an end of term atmosphere and a lot of good natured heckling from a slightly inebriated crowd. Richard's final guest is Peter Dickson impersonator and product of 1988, Joe Lycett. The podcast largely turns into the vehicle for a RHLSTP clips show as Joe quizzes Richard about his favourite and least favourite guests and what the future might hold for the valuable RHLSTP franchise. But there's also time to talk about identifying fish as they are slapped into your face, how much money Richard turned down to appear on TV with Katie Hopkins and the varying depravity of ex Blue Peter presenters. It's a fittingly low key and relaxed end to the series. Series 8 starts next week.","categories":[]},{"mediaGroups":[{"contents":[{"url":"http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/226293621-britishcomedyguide-richard-herring-lst-podcast-80-limmy.mp3","fileSize":"142195377","type":"audio/mpeg"}]}],"title":"Episode 80 - Limmy","link":"http://www.comedy.co.uk/podcasts/richard_herring_lst_podcast/episode_80_limmy/","author":"Comedy.co.uk","publishedDate":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 11:25:00 -0700","contentSnippet":"RHLSTP #80: Limmy.

Richard is a bit worried about the psychological similarities he shares with murder spree killers, but maybe that's just all comedians. If you read his book you might worry the same thing about this week's guest, cult comedy genius and normal-faced man Limmy. The pair try and fail to remember an ancient Twitter spat, and Richard threatens to reignite it by trying to welcome his guest by talking to him in his own language. There's a lively discussion of Scottish politics, the sexual allure of fake tan and whether it's funny to envisage the death of your own father.

Richard delves into the seedy personal life of Dean and Matilda on the front row, before introducing failed politician and thwarted parachutist Al Murray. They chat about whether it's possible to gauge how an audience is laughing at comedy; running around in some wasteland in your pants at night; the downfall of Farage; and the bizarre social media exchanges that Al's attempt to become an MP led to. Also some glider-based history anecdotes; fears for the Westfield shopping centre; and peach stones in the dishwasher.

Richard has witnessed a man carrying out his ultimate fantasy, but realises that sometimes maybe fantasies belong in our heads, not in reality. He is joined by the delightfully gossipy, quizzer, doctor, comedian and Sinnerman Paul Sinha. Obviously they mainly talk about quizzes and their own disastrous TV appearances; but also discuss the least funny sitcom flatshare of all time; John Oliver's tyre knowledge; the subplot running through these 78 podcasts; the difficulty of knowing if words begin and end with the same letter; notorious joke thieves; David Icke - madman or genius; and Rich's plans for an appearance on Tipping Point. What happened when Sinha told Herring that he used to fancy him? And can you work out which famous comic asked him to diagnose a sexually transmitted disease? Who will be done for libel? There's also a revealing discussion about the nature of happiness.","categories":[]},{"mediaGroups":[{"contents":[{"url":"http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/223298305-britishcomedyguide-richard-herring-lst-podcast-77-brett-goldstein.mp3","fileSize":"114306593","type":"audio/mpeg"}]}],"title":"Episode 77 - Brett Goldstein","link":"http://www.comedy.co.uk/podcasts/richard_herring_lst_podcast/episode_77_brett_goldstein/","author":"Comedy.co.uk","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 16:58:00 -0700","contentSnippet":"RHLSTP #77: Brett Goldstein - Routines About Buttons.

They talk about looking dead eyed into a camera on Weekend Kitchen at Waitrose, working with the Hoff, what it's like on Halloween when you're the only single man on your street, whether sex with a faceless robot counts as cheating and how important it is to get the full consent of the big man and the tiny man.

They discuss webbed toes, being the responsible one in a gang of Hell's Angels, John Inverdale's slip of the tongue, the deferred creative revenge on the tedious admin of life and who of the two of them is a more realistic representation for the hopes and dreams of new comedians.

They discuss the autobiographies of Don Estelle and Syd Little, how Robin created The Office, a swearing Su Pollard, Iain Lee on a pink tricycle, the funniest serial killer and being the Giant Sand of comedy. Richard also quizzes about his decision to (at least temporarily) give up stand-up. It would be a shame. He's very funny. Having said that, he does seem to be in a very happy mood so why ruin that?

Alas he gets distracted into discussing aversion to non-binding cheese; how thunder storms are the UK's biggest killer; advertising pear cider, and the criticisms that engendered; and Watson's love of dry stone-walling.

Giving away a prize to a lucky audience member, Rich reminisces about schoolday bags and realises how much work he has got to do to re-learn his 11 old stand-up shows for his insane attempt to do them all at the Leicester Square Theatre in August and September. His guest is a man who has done Chekov, Dickens and Celebrity Juice, Johnny Vegas. It's a truly fascinating discussion about the duality of the stand-up and where a Johnny ends and Michael Pennington begins. Michael discusses the lengths that Johnny would push him to and his total commitment to being a dog on stage, whether contentment and success mean the death of the character, how to make your own audience out of balloons, why he got the worst degree in his year at University and how he got his revenge. Plus how Monkey has clung to his back like a monkey, and the funniest sex show in history.
